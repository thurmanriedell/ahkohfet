                            <p> has anyone experience yet in migrating from sbs2011 to win server 2019? i understand that the migration path is available via powershell commands by haven't been able to find much on this yet. if so care to share your experience. In short - I have an app/web server and application running on Win10 in Azure. It is performing fine. Now I know it is generally recommended to host your applications on Windows Server as opposed to Win10 OS, but i keep finding it difficult to find what benefits I would get if I switched to using more expensive image. Any advice. Dota 2 has been around for 10 years and you still can't handle patch launches, fuck yourself valve. Hi, I'm studying for my Cert 4 in IT networking and part of my assessment is to complete the tasks outlined in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf7AnVR9qV0 I am stuck at around the 6m10sec mark as when I select "Generate Transform" I get a popup stating that "setup.ini" is missing. I add this file as described in the video, but the issue still persists and I get the same popup. Can anyone point me in the right direction for how to fix this? Thanks in advance Hey guys, i've been lurking this subreddit all day in hopes to find some guidance as i'm somewhat lost on how to begin, i'm looking into getting the MCSA (at least the 740 and 741) within the next 2 months, i already have some study material ready but i'm having problems deciding what's the best set up for a virtual lab, i'm running a R5 1600 (which i could upgrade to a R7 if you guys recommend it) and 16gb of ram so i'm pretty sure i can run a decent lab in this, but what would be the optimal. Hi, I'm new to r/homelab and I'm experimenting a bit at home with Windows Server. I've used Citrix from time to time at work and would like to experiment a bit running Citrix at home. I have a laptop with a core i7, 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter. However I can't seem to find many details on how to install this. amp#x200B; My goal would be for my parents and/or guests to use our main (weak) living room desktop to connect through Citrix to do some work on a faster. 
Honestly I'm not an expert in servers/domain (I'm more of a network guy) but am trying to help out with this issue we have going on at work. It's a Windows 2012 server environment and there is a physical server that end users RDP into to access software. There is a VM domain hosted there locally and also a backup cloud VM domain. Here is the issue, sometimes when a user logs into their RDP account, when they try to open any program they get this error message: https://i.imgur.com/JBPXmed.png. Hi all, I am wondering if anyone is running window server 2019 as a home server and what services are you using? I am setting up a domain and syncing with azure ad. Looking at different file services but its a bit different from 2012 essentials. Hey there, We are wanting to do an in-place upgrade to our KMS Server to Server 2016. However, we do have some installations of Office 2010 in our environment and I have seen reports that there are issues activating Office 2010 with a 2016 host. According to this link for the Microsoft Office 2010 KMS Host License Pack: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25095 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25095) Under "System Requirements" it says Windows. 
I am trying to create a small app to help manage our shared servers. Multiple users login to a VDI desktop using personal credentials. But from this shared machine, they login to other shared "work" servers using shared credentials. Each "work" server can have two users. Problem is that each session of the work machines does not know which user is logged in because all we know of the incoming connections is the IPAddress (which is the same for all VDI users since its shared desktop) Hi. New to this sub but hope you guys can help. amp#x200B; Very similar to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/50qg32/problem\_hyperv\_autostart\_not\_working\_on\_win\_10/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/50qg32/problem_hyperv_autostart_not_working_on_win_10/) amp#x200B; u/MaCuban said i need to add the identity the management service is running as to log in as service. But I am not sure how to do this amp#x200B; Any help would be nice. Right Yes, I know, super old machines. The file share is shared with ‘everyone’ but for some reason when I try to connect from the 2k3 machine it says I don’t have permission. Thoughts? These machines are only part of a workgroup. Looking for a good tool to migrate. Does windows come with one? We have several dental programs that run on the server and a bunch Microsoft is really jamming the virtual community with their new licensing model. i.e. License every single core, even if the VM doesn't even use it. amp#x200B; My case: small 4 host cluster, but each with a beefy physical cpu/core count. We have 1 dumb provider who want's a Windows server VM for their application as opposed to the Linux option. We complied, but now to navigate the license nightmare. amp#x200B; I understand the microsoft greedy way to be: Licensing all cores I have two physical servers. One is running Server 2016 and the other is Server 2019. I can remotely connect to both of them from my Mac using he Microsoft Remote Desktop software from the App Store using either the hostname or the IP address. Both work. If, however, I try to use my iPad with the same application, It will not let me connect to either using the hostname. I must use the IP address. I thought initially that it had something to do with DNS (reverse lookup zone, I did verify 
Hi. I've heard that you can map network paths for AD users automatically with a logon script, but I haven't found any way to do this. Does anyone We have an OnPrem exchange server, with the OWA url "mail. company inc.org" which after a successful login is redirecting to "mail. company org" with an error that the "DNS Name does not exist" in Edge, and similar messages in other browsers. The same error occurred when logging into the Exchange Admin Center, even when browsing to localhost through IIS. Manually adding "inc" to the url would throw a 404 or 400 error code. We checked HTTP redirects in IIS, the config settings appea. I have a port that just won't open for some reason. It is showing in the Windows Firewall that Outbound and inbound rules are allowing it. It clearly shows it in both Rules with a green check mark. However, when I go to do a netstat -a it isn't showing it as a port listening and when testing with telnet it isn't showing up. I also ran the command via command line with admin and it created the rule within the Windows Firewall. So I made it in both the GUI and command line. It shows traffic. so i was playing around in hyperv yesterday installing different virtual machines. when i decided to install winXP. It installed fine, but the mouse would not work. After doing a little research i found out that microsoft decided that since xp was no longer supported that they would not include the drivers for it in server 2019. so i downloaded a legacy copy of integration services guest services. installed it and got xp working. but today when i rebooted win10pro vm the mouse. Like BDO level p2w, like 1000$ per armor piece p2w. Seems like it would be easy money for them with no drawbacks in player satisfaction. Hi, I'm having a little trouble with my network here. I'm hosting 2 Windows Server 2016 instances, one at the HQ and one as a branch, some 60 km away from there. I have set up an Active Directory Domain, DHCP Servers and DNS Server successfully. Between the HQ and the branch office, I have set-up a persistent Dial-Up Connection with RRAS to connect the two networks. Communication via IPv4 works flawless, I can RemoteDesktop from HQ into the "offsite" Server. amp#x200B; Now I also wanted.
