(This. I know it's a bit early, but here's my finished card for the 2019 /r/Fantasy Bingo (https://i.imgur.com/U4bikDx.jpg)! Why? When asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, George Mallory famously answered "Because it's there.". Same thing, except replacing Mallory with me and Mount Everest with Mount TBR. Also, I actually reached my goal so I guess I win this one. How? I had an accident in March which left me with a broken foot and six weeks of medical leave (ending tomorrow). Until. May the gods help me make it to the end of this post.and I warn, this is gonna be REAL long. Hi all. My name is Emmylou. I decided to hop on here, because I'm pretty sure my biggest piece of identity is being a widow. So I guess I'll write out my tragic tale, and those of you who read to the end, I may suggest tissues.I make people cry every time I tell even just part of my story. But I think it may be therapeutic to write it all out, to those who will understand. Here goes. One summer when I was a kid, I had a genius for a friend. Perhaps friend is a strong word. Dimitri was simply the boy my age who lived in the house behind mine. But a genius he absolutely was. Dimtri loved strategy games. First, we played chess and when he grew bored of beating me in that, we played the Pokemon card game…then Magic: the Gathering, then Warhammer 40K (using the meager armies we could afford, of course). I never won any of these games, save for one time that Dimitri didn’t realiz. This was an experience I had along side my bff in high school. This was about 2006, maybe 2007, in rural upstate New York. We met in third grade, and are still friends to this day. We are both 27 now. Let me give you some background information now. My friend, "Bee", and I became instant friends when we met in third grade, and were inseparable. We frequented each other's homes so much so her mom set up her guest room as "my" room, I had toys, clothes, pictures, I mean everything I needed. I’ve noticed something. Over the last few weeks, Austin’s been losing left, right, and center. How about this. Austin can be the new Curt Hawkins, losing to everyone. Then, one day, out of the blue, say, his 15th match, he goes and win. Against who, you ask? The Mediterranean Champion, Macho Mack Maverick. After this, he gets a title shot, and wins. Also, we’re doing bios in the roster now apparently, so, here ya go. -Peter Nicholas Ramirez (born April 12, 1992) is from Philadelphia, Pennsy. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0643107/?ref\_=ttep\_ep1 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0643107/?ref_=ttep_ep1) Masters of Horror is a series that aired 2005-2007, created by Mick Garris. Garris got a number of horror heroes together and each contributed a one-hour episode. Episode 1 is “Incident On and Off a Mountain Road”, which aired in October 2005. Based on a short story by Joe R. Lansdale and directed by Don Coscarelli (Phantasm, Bubba Ho-Tep, John Dies at the End). I looked up the directo. 
GM: Title Wave -Title Wave (Born July 17, 1993 as Michael Amarras) is the owner and CEO of European Union Pro Wrestling. Born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Amarras got into pro wrestling from his parents bringing him to WWE Vengeance in 2002, where he quickly became enamored with the sport. He would begin working in amateur wrestling and kickboxing, and begun pro wrestling at the age of 15. He initially debuted with a skater gimmick under the ring name “Mike Amarras,” though he finally Beyond the anti-Hereditarian fallacies laid out in Gottfredson (2009) ( there are many others. I will outline a short collection of these here. Some pieces linked may themselves be fine, though they're variously misused on Reddit and elsewhere, and that will be addressed. These come primarily from /u/stairway-to-kevin, who has used them at various times. It is likely that Kevin doesn't make up his own arguments, because he appears not to understand. Hey, everyone. A month from today begins the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Asia's quadrennial continental tournament. Consider this a sort of spirit sequel to late 2017's post "What history says about the next World Cup winner", in which I used a step by step elimination process of Stats to determine the likely victor in Russia. With moderate success, the post, which can be found below, narrowed down the winner to one of either France (!!) or Brazil. https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/79ka. 09845982601 BMS established in 1946, is today amongst the top engineering colleges in India. The news magazine \amp#39;Outlook\amp#39; has ranked BMS as 1st in Karnataka \ampamp; 11th in India amongst the finest Private Engineering Colleges. BMS is affiliated to the VTU and recognized by the Government of Karnataka and the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi. BMS Institutes offer four year degree courses in various branches of engineering and post graduate. It all started when my dad secured a PHD sponsorship to Harvard university back in 2007. I followed everything at Massachusetts, Celtics became my LOVE. The Truth (Paul Pierce) in particular made my love for Celtics inseparable. In the society we live in today, with cell phones, social media, and forensic science growing exponentially, it's hard to fathom crimes going unsolved. What's even more difficult to comprehend is when all of those things are combined in one mystery and answers are still unable to be produced. So when two young girls go hiking on a canceled school day and record their adventure on Snapchat, nobody expected the devastating turn of events, but people were hopeful the case would be solved quickly. So last week, I made this thread (https://old.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/9fy5j1/hey_rph_lets_rank_our_top_10_favorite_pinoy/) to see what the sub's favorite movies of all time. So without further ado here's /r/PH's Top 10 Favorite Pinoy Movies of All Time. --- #1. MAGINIFICO (2003) (https://imgur.com/gOsC4ex.jpg) Directed By: Maryo J.

I guess I'll Just start from the beginning. Sorry if its kind of long!.It was 2007 and I was 13 when I met my this girl, let's just name her Alex. We were in middle school in New York City, a place where the shoes you wore mattered more than your ability to hold an intellectual conversation. Finding her was a blessing, she was smart, funny and adventurous. loving her was the easiest thing I've ever done in my life. We were inseparable throughout high school, we had our own world within. Hello redditors, I'm posting this more for my own cathartic need but could use advice from others outside of my friends and family. I'll preface this post by saying it will be long. A bit of a backstory: I first met Anne in 2007 on plentyoffish. We set up a date and I cancelled the day of saying I was sick. A dick move admittedly. Fast forward to 2010, we are both on OKCupid and start talking again. She calls me out for cancelling the date and says I owe her a proper date.

July 25, 2007. Mom went to a concert alone. I was bedding down for the night. It was quite late. Suddenly, dad knocked on mine and my sister's door. Mom wanted us to come with dad to collect mom from the station. Mom's orders, she insisted we come. My sister was FURIOUS, but I was quite excited for a night drive. Mom had met a HUGE star at the concert and that's why she wanted us all to come. Take two. Bedded down for the night. July 26, 2007, a few minutes past midnight. I dreamt I was walkin. When the GOAT QB discussion gets brought up, there are 3 main names that are stated: Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Joe Montana. Now Peyton Manning and Tom Brady have been compared for their entire careers, but when you compare to someone like Joe Montana, usually the extent of comparisons goes to how many SBs they won, went to, and some randomly selected stats that sound impressive (Montana never threw a pick in 4 Superbowls, Brady passed Montana for the most touchdowns thrown in a Superbowl. </p>
