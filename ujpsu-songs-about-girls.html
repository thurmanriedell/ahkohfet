                            <p> I haven't roamed through the entire discography, haven't examined album by album, and haven"t dissected every song. However, I have a general gist of knowledge regarding sound of the various Metallica albums (simply by skimming through songs, rather than listening to a whole album). I only listen to select songs that I like from the songs that I come across - it's usually from the first 3 albums. However, of all the Metallica songs I know, I noticed romance/sex isn't a subject! Or, maybe. I thought was sung by Miguel but cant find the song. The singing has some hard pauses in it to emphasize the points. Near the beginning or beginning has about the girl throwing the clothes or hitting the guy and now the whole neighborhood knows. I heard it a bunch of times on my Kanye West pandora channel early last year, but now cant find it or get it to play anymore. Couldve sworn was by miguel but listened to his songs Long shot here but I remember listening to it on youtube with an animated music video with two girls playing UNO against each other alternating singing and playing tricks on each other. Had a catchy pop tune. I probably heard it about 5 years ago. I know that's not a lot to go on but much appreciated. I made a new EP. It’s a few songs about girls. Soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/user-904486954/sets/songs-about-girls (https://soundcloud.com/user-904486954/sets/songs-about-girls) Smart url (http://smarturl.it/suw4b6). basically this song was a bit of a meme a year or so ago. this japanese looking girl warps around playing her guitar in different places and in one of the locations, i think a small city center there is a man jumping to his death in the background barely visible. Never actually listened to the song so can't say much about the actual tune. Thanks in advance. 
i saw this years ago on the internet but cannot remember what it is, main thing i remember is a female singer singing about a girl needing to listen/come home, scaffolding in the background with teenagers slapping up question mark sings, early to mid 2000s NOT WHERE Okay, I may be WAY off about what the song is about. I just remember the guy singing about a girl living in the Valley (possibly Reseda?) and hanging out with guys like Bob Seger. I very specifically remember Bob Seger's name coming up, but Googling "Bob Seger song" obviously doesn't yield helpful results. It's not Free Fallin' by Tom Petty. It's a 90s song, by someone like Train or Cake. It's slower, and the singer has a deeper voice. I think it's pretty stream-of-consciousness, with fairly. I was listening to the Panic at the disco radio station on google play music and a song popped up that was a guy singing about a girl that lied about using drugs I think? I liked the song and I can't find what its called. 
In a sweet and sentimental mood right now. Don't know much about these kinds of songs but that sentiment of a girl being excited/interested/infatuated by a guy is something that really appeals to me these. All I can remember is the premise of the song being a girl having dumped a guy but then is jealous of his new girlfriend and sings about how he used to take her to the restaurants and places they go now. It's like a Top 40 a pop song type of song from the past couple of years. I can't remember beyond. You know what I'm talking about. The ones I've found that I like to believe are a bit gay (or does include female appreciation I've got low standards okay) are: Weezer Thank God For Girls Beatrice Eli Girls My Chemical Romance Not That Kind Of Girl (it's sung by a dude, but I like to think the character he's singing as is a girl) Anything by Ally Hills Hot by Avril Lavigne (it's gender-neutral) I found an actual band called Lesbians On Ecstasy Girls/girls/boys by panic! At the disco if you're bisexual. She Keeps. I've searched the lyrics and concept and still can't find the song. The lyrics I remember were sung by the female lead singer "But she's plastic, is that what I want to be?" The song was about girls accepting themselves for who they are, but it had a rock edge, the music video taking place in a moody, dimly lit warehouse type setting. Scenes included different girls looking into a full-length mirror, and that mirror eventually shattering by the end of the video. I vaguely remember the band lying. </p>
